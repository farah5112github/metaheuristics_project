# metaheuristics_project

In this project, two metaheuristics algorithms are used. They are Genetic algorithm and Simulated Annealing. I have used different parent selection, crossover and mutation methods of Genetic Algothim. For simulated Annealing I have used different temperatures. In the table, instead of single, I have to wirte "random" mutation.
They are all listed below :
